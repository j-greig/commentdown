# Commentdown

Append-only structured comments in markdown. One log per file under `## Comments`. Each entry: heading badge says kind, ID says who/when, route says who acts next, threading via `replies:` / `closes:`, `falsifies:` keeps claims honest, `tag:` clusters topics.

## Before writing — read the room

1. Find `## Comments` in the target file.
2. Read `commentdown:` frontmatter for `version`, `profile`, `order`, `registry.handles`, and `arbitration` rules. Routes must use exact registered handles.
   **Determine entry order**: `commentdown.order` is authoritative; else the heading suffix (`(newest first)` / `(oldest first)`); a bare `## Comments` with neither keeps its existing physical order (match how prior entries were added; when unclear, append at the end). Never reorder prior entries.
3. Scan the latest open `[REQ]` / `[WATCH]` / `[CLAIM]` and entries routed at your handle.
4. If responding to an existing entry, set `replies:` to its ID. If the work closes a thread, also set `closes:`.

## Generating the ID — never guess

Comment IDs are clock-sourced, never hand-authored. Use the **bundled helper form** that ships with this skill:

```bash
python3 scripts/cd_id.py <author> <slug> [collision]
# → cd-20260509-114640-agent-reviewer-test-slug
```

Resolve `scripts/cd_id.py` relative to this skill directory.

`<author>` is your registered handle (with or without `@`). `<slug>` is `^[a-z0-9-]+$`, lowercased, ≤ ~16 chars, semantic. `[collision]` is a positional `1..99`, only when another entry already shares the second-resolution timestamp + author + slug.

> **Project helpers may have a different CLI shape.** Some adopting repos ship their own `commentdown_id.py` with a `--collision <nn>` flag instead of the positional form. Both are valid — the bundled helper is the one this skill is documented against; if a project supplies a different CLI, follow its `--help` output.

POSIX fallback when Python is unavailable:

```bash
date -u +'cd-%Y%m%d-%H%M%S-<author>-<slug>'
```

## Writing the entry

Placement follows the order you determined above. Never edit a prior entry — use `[ERRATA]` with `errata_for:` for factual corrections.

- **`newest-first`** (however determined — frontmatter, heading suffix, or inferred from a legacy log's existing placement): insert the new entry directly UNDER the comments heading, above the previous latest entry, whatever the heading form (`## Comments`, `## Comments (newest first)`). `cat >>` is wrong here — use your host's edit primitive to insert after the heading line, touching nothing else. Shell-only fallback (matches any comments-heading form):

```bash
awk '1; /^## Comments/ && !done {while ((getline l < "/tmp/entry.md") > 0) print l; done=1}' file.md > file.md.tmp && mv file.md.tmp file.md
```

- **`oldest-first`** (declared, inferred, or genuinely ambiguous legacy): append at the end of the file with a heredoc; **do not** use editor-style rewrites when other agents may be appending to the same file:

```bash
cat >> path/to/file.md <<'EOF'

## [REQ] cd-20260509-114640-agent-reviewer-test-slug · One-line title
@agent-driver: single sentence naming the next action.

Body. Lead with the delta. Concrete over abstract. File:line evidence inline.

falsifies: <what evidence would overturn this entry>
tag: <topic-cluster>
EOF
```

> **Host-agent variant.** If your host agent forbids shell writes (e.g., Codex's `apply_patch`-only file-edit mode), use its sanctioned append/edit primitive instead — but preserve the append-only semantics exactly: a single new entry at the position the declared order requires, no rewrite of any prior entry, immediate `git status` re-check before committing.

After appending, re-run `git status` and commit standalone (CD-only commits keep the audit trail clean).

## Required vs optional fields

**Always required**: heading (`## [VERDICT] <id> · <title>`), body, `falsifies:`, `tag:`.

**Conditionally required**:
- `@<actor>:` — required on `[REQ]`, `[CLAIM]`, `[DEC]`. One primary route only. `cc:` is FYI, not assignment.
- `errata_for:` — required on `[ERRATA]`.

**Optional** (recommended for long bodies): `status:`, `refs:`, `replies:`, `closes:`, `cc:`, `tldr:`, `due_by:`.

In **strict** profile, `status:` and `refs:` (or `refs: none`) become mandatory. Check the file's `commentdown.profile` — default is `minimal`.

Optional fields must earn their keep. Assume agents can inspect the repo with
filesystem and git tools. Skip `refs:`, `cc:`, `tldr:`, file names, or reader
directions when they only repeat what the heading, route, body, git diff, or
local filesystem already show.

Primary audience is other agents. Keep entries dry and short. No praise, speed
notes, process recap, or chatty status prose. Fragments are fine if clear.

## Verdict choice

| Want to | Use |
|---|---|
| Ask another actor to do something | `[REQ]` |
| Take a piece of in-flight work | `[CLAIM]` |
| Record a binding decision | `[DEC]` |
| Accept and close a reviewer concern | `[PASS]` |
| Accept directionally but flag follow-ups | `[WATCH]` |
| Reject or block | `[FAIL]` |
| Report state, no verdict | `[INFO]` |
| Correct a factual error in a prior entry | `[ERRATA]` (with `errata_for:`) |

> **Proactive `[CLAIM]` warning.** If you take work without a parent `[REQ]`, the claim is *proactive* and **must route to an arbitrator** (per the registry's `arbitration:` block) with a one-line explanation of why the work was not requested first. Responsive claims (with `replies:` to a parent `[REQ]`) route to whoever the REQ asked for the work.

For full rules, read the canonical spec:

## Style

- Lead with the delta. Skip pleasantries.
- Concrete over abstract: `polling, seen=482, age=0.4min` beats "watchdog looks fine".
- One fact, one owner. Verdict lives in the heading badge; topic in `tag:`; primary route in `@<actor>:`. Don't restate them in prose.
- Preserve coordination facts that are easy to lose; don't inventory obvious files, headings, or reading paths.
- Do not duplicate commit messages. CD carries coordination/rationale; commit
  carries terse code delta or CD ID.
- Keep `falsifies:` honest and concrete — it converts a vibe into a falsifiable claim.
- Skip the post if you have nothing material to add since the last entry.

## Worked example: respond to a routed request

You see this in the file:

```markdown
## [REQ] cd-20260509-095322-agent-reviewer-api-plan-req · API refactor review
@agent-driver: add rollback criteria and unsafe-scope notes before implementation.
…
tag: api-refactor
```

After shipping the work in a separate commit, append a closing `[INFO]` (or `[PASS]` if reviewing):

```bash
ID=$(python3 scripts/cd_id.py agent-driver api-rollback-added)
cat >> docs/API-REFACTOR.md <<EOF

## [INFO] $ID · API rollback criteria added
status: info
refs: docs/API-REFACTOR.md
closes: cd-20260509-095322-agent-reviewer-api-plan-req

Rollback criteria and unsafe-scope notes are now explicit before implementation.
Body includes concrete file:line evidence and verification commands.

falsifies: docs/API-REFACTOR.md lacks rollback criteria or still allows runtime config edits
tag: api-refactor
EOF
git add docs/API-REFACTOR.md
git commit -m "docs: cd api rollback criteria"
```

## What this skill is NOT

- Not the spec. The spec at `https://github.com/j-greig/commentdown` is authoritative; this skill is a how-to for agents writing valid entries.
- Not project-specific. Per-project safety gates (which paths are protected, which actors can promote, which writes are forbidden) live in that project's own docs/frontmatter, not here.
- Not an orchestrator. Skill helps you write one entry correctly; coordination across multiple entries / files / plans is the agent loop's job.
